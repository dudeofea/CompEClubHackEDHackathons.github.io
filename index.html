                    <p>Hackathons are for designing, creating and building awesome projects. HackEDbeta is an open and welcoming event that provides a great learning environment for students of all backgrounds. Whether or not you have programmed before does not matter! We want you here despite your level of experience!</p>

                    <strong>Mentorship</strong>
                    <p>Mentors from graduate school and industry representatives will be available throughout the event to help students along with their projects.</p>

                    <strong>Competition</strong>
                    <p>Worried about being in a competition? Don’t be! The competition aspect is optional - if you wish to opt out of presenting your project at the end, you can. This hackathon is all about learning something new and the environment will be extremely laid back. The prizes are sweet, and so is the swag!</p>

                    <p>Hackathons are filled with passionate students who are willing to try something. These are the students that will go on to be creative problem solvers and energetic personalities in our communities. </p>

                    <p>Mentoring at HackEDbeta is a great opportunity to work with these young talents on a face-to-face level. Get engaged in the problems they’re solving over the 24 hours, and support them through their adventure. </p>

                    <p>Help students past their roadblocks and guide them towards a solution. 24 hours can be a lot time so we’ve broken up the time; choose between starter pack, eager minds, the headache, zombie, early bird, and get’er done shifts. </p>

                    <p>HackED Beta is one of the annual student hackathons hosted by the Computer Engineering Club at the University of Alberta. On the 18th and 19th of November, we are hoping to push around 60 – 80 students to learn and build amazing projects for 24 hours. The event will be held at Startup Edmonton (301, 10359 104 St Mercer Warehouse).</p>
                    
                    <strong>Why Sponsor</strong>
                    <p>Most hackathons are highly competitive in spirit. We believe that such competitive events can bring out amazing work but can also be intimidating for developers just getting started in the industry. Our goal with this event is to create a hackathon with less emphasis on competition and more on learning and trying out new technologies. To do this we are planning on bringing more mentors and hosting workshops throughout the event. We want developers with little to no experience to feel welcome and feel encouraged to learn while still having a bit of competition to push them forward.</p>

                    <strong>Join Us</strong>
                    <p>HackED Beta is a great opportunity for your company to get to see and promote some of the raw talent we have here in Edmonton. We hope you can help us grow Edmonton’s tech community.</p>
