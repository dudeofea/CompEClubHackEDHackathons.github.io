                    Hackathons are for designing, creating and building awesome projects. <b>HackEDbeta is an open and welcoming event that provides a great learning environment for students of all backgrounds.</b> Whether or not you have programmed before does not matter! We want you here despite your level of experience!
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Mentors</b> from graduate school and industry are available to help students along with their projects. 
                    <br><br>
                    Worried about being in a competition? Don’t be! The <b>competition aspect is optional</b> - if you wish to opt out of presenting your project at the end, you can. This hackathon is all about learning something new and the environment will be extremely laid back.

                    <h1>Where does it come from?</h1>
                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                </div>
                <div class="page green" id="three">
                    <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                <div class="page yellow" id="four">
                    <h1>Where can I get some?</h1>
                    There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

                    <li>
                        <p class="question">What happens at a hackathon?</p>
                        <p class="answer">For 24 hours, participants work together in teams of 1 to 5 people to build a project. Teams can work on hardware or software projects. There is no limit on creativity. This hackathon acts as a sort of incubator to your mini projects as it provides a focused time to work on your idea with mentors and workshops to help you along.</p>

                    <li>

                        <p class="answer">Not at all! The hackathon’s purpose is to create a welcoming and supportive environment to learn. That works for any experience level, and any type of learning. The hackathon has plenty of mentors and resources to help you work on your hack. It’s the best place to try something new.</p>

                        <p class="answer">Our hackathon has a competition portion where you will present your work at the end, but this is NOT mandatory. If you do not feel comfortable entering the competition with your work, no worries! At the event you can opt out before presentations begin on Sunday. The most important part of this hackathon is that you come out of it having tried something new.</p>

If you want to hack as a team, be sure to be proactive during these opportunities! Alternatively, if you have a team and want to find an additional member, these are also opportunities for your team.</p>

A good recommendation for coming up with ideas is to think about annoyances in your everyday life that you could potentially solve. Talk to your friends and family to help you!</p>
